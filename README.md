## What is ClickAuth?
- ClickAuth is a **simple** authentication (AuthMe) plugin for offline servers.
- I created this plugin because it was really hard to find an actual authentication plugin that was *working properly* and *not causing any issues*.

## Features
- **Effortless** usage with no commands.
- You can simply enter your password in chat when you're prompted to.
- *Most of the time*, you will **automatically be logged in** through IP.
- You'll only have to login manually if your IP changes.
- **/resetpassword** to change your current password.
- *Advanced* password encryption.

## How to use
### When you first join the server
- You will be prompted to enter a password in chat.

- After entering a password, you will then have to confirm your password.

### Logging in
- Most of the time **you won't have to log in manually** unless your IP changes.
- In which case you will be prompted to enter your password.

- If you try too many times, *you will be kicked.*

### Changing your password
- To change your password, use the command **/resetpassword**.
- You will then be prompted to enter a new password and to confirm it.
